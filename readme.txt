== Description ==

No tracking, no logins, no extracurricular scripts.   This plugin provides social media icons to share your post without the BS.  

This plugin is designed for the pure purpose of having social media icons above and/or below your posts with Google's Page Speed score in mind.  Other plugins load scripts that lead to "Remove unused Javascript", "Eliminate render-blocking resources", or "Reduce JavaScript execution time" flags.  This plugin will not load any javascript on the front-end and will only load the social media icons and a short string of styles to your page - unless you don't want it to.

You can also choose to not automatically show the icons anywhere (choose "None" for placement in the settings) and instead use a shortcode:  
`
[njss text="Share this post on:" networks="facebook,twitter,pinterest,email" icon_size="32"]
`

This plugin currently only has Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, and email built in.
